# sys_micrograd : An Auto Differentiation Engine
Implementation of a Auto Differentiation Engine

- The engine is a PyTorch-like API for building and training small neural networks using backpropagation (reverse-mode autodiff) 
- It operates on scalar values and can be used to construct simple deep neural networks
- This was created for educational purposes to learn how autodiffrentiation is implimented in a library/engine
